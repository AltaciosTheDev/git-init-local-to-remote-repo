    Building a quiz game 

        FUNCTIONALIES:
            1)increase score
            2)decrease score
            3)delete user 
            4)log in 
            5)log out 
            6)add avatar 
            7)get score

        USER OBJECT PROPERTIES:
            1)name
            2)score

        OBJECTS: Native data structure that can store data and functionality 

        ENCAPSULATION: IDEA of storing data AND functionality SIDE BY SIDE, and update DATA based on functionality 

        WAYS TO CREATE OBJECTS REPETITIVELY (NOT DRY)
            1)object literals     -> literally defining object, label, properties and methods 
            2)initialize empty + add property
                a) dot notation 
                b)bracket notation 
            3)Object.create(null) -> will create an empty object NO MATTER what we put inside

            JAVASCRIPT OBJECT 
                literally an already built in object by JS with available methods that will initialize an empty object no matter what we write inside.

        WAY TO CREATE OBJECTS EFFECTIVELY 
            1)generate objects using a function 
                PROBLEM: every time we create a user, we make space in memory for all data and functions. 
            2)PROTOTYPE CHAIN 
            
        WHEN INVOKING A FUNCTION JS OPENS A GLOBAL EXECUTION CONTEXT 
            1)function definition with name userCreator 
            2)goes to whereever the function was invoked and take a look at the argumnts provided 
            3)open local execution context that comes with local memory 
            4)pair arguments with parameters in local memory 
            5)enter function definition 
                a)newuser in local memory {}
                b)declare property b/c they don't exist and look for the argument we passed earlier in local memory 
                c)will pass user one info to global memory that was cretaed earlier 

        USING PROTOTPE CHAIN AND ACCESSING THEM
